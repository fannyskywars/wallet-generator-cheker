# Crypto wallet finder - Software to find lost crypto wallets - Wallet Finder - Crypto Checker

**Wallet Gen** is a tool designed for brute force and generating cryptocurrency wallets (such as **Bitcoin** and **EVM-based** wallets like **ETH, BNB, MATIC, etc.**), as well as discovering forgotten or lost wallets that contain an existing balance.

## Overview

**Wallet Gen** is built in C++ and is open-source, allowing anyone to access and modify the code. Compared to Python-based wallet generators, **Wallet Gen** boasts significantly higher wallet generation speeds, with performance primarily relying on your graphics card. 
For generating EVM wallets (ETH, BNB, MATIC, etc.), Wallet Gen uses the keccak256 algorithm, while Bitcoin wallets are created using the Segwit format under Bech32.

## Features

1. <b>Generate a single Bitcoin wallet.</b>
2. <b>Generate a single EVM wallet (ETH, BNB, MATIC, etc.).</b>
3. <b>Search BTC wallets with balance (using the Internet - slower).</b>
4. <b>Search BTC wallets with balance (using the database - faster).</b>
5. <b>Search EVM wallets with balance (using the Internet - slower).</b>
6. <b>Search EVM wallets with balance (using the database - faster).</b>

The search speed is determined by your hardware, especially your graphics card. To increase your chances of finding a wallet with a balance, you can run multiple instances of the program, from 1 to 4, depending on the power of your graphics card.

## My Finds

I’ve personally recovered two BTC wallets with a balance. The first had 0.000032 BTC, the second contained 0.0528 BTC (roughly $4800 at the time of discovery).  
Here’s the link to the wallet: [bc1qk3m62hx2hh5mhvc0tj45f9xflzcnu0sur3rvay](https://mempool.space/address/bc1qk3m62hx2hh5mhvc0tj45f9xflzcnu0sur3rvay).

### New Find 4/9/2025

After a week of non-stop wallet searching, I finally found a [wallet](https://mempool.space/address/bc1q29c5m3w4jxtsj4vcd2ccw4t68xm8m7vs5vytu0) with 0.25 bitcoin ($19k). This is my 4th and biggest find of all time.
